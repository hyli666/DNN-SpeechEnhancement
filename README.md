# DNN-SpeechEnhancement

Use TensorFlow to implement a DNN-based speech enhancement system, which refers to the paper below: 

[1] Xu Y, Du J, Dai L R, et al. A regression approach to speech enhancement based on deep neural networks[J]. IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio Speech & Language Processing, 2015, 23(1):7-19.

Only the traning script is provided here.

## Procedure:

* 1 Prepare you data in the form of mat format.

* 2 Use this script to train NN. The result will be saved in mat format.

* 3 In enhancement stage, just do what [1] did.
